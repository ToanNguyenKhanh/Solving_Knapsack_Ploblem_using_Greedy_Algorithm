# Solving Knapsack Problem using Greedy Algorithm

## Overview
This repository contains an implementation of the Greedy Algorithm to solve the Knapsack Problem, a classic optimization problem in computer science. The Knapsack Problem involves selecting a combination of items with specific weights and values to maximize the value while not exceeding a given weight capacity.
